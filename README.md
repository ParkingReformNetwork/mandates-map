# Parking Reform Network Map

This code runs the Mandates Map app for the Parking Reform Network: https://parkingreform.org/mandates-map/.

It is written in R, but in the process of being converted to JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The app is built in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), so you need to install:

- System software:
  - R ('r-base' in Debian/Ubuntu)
  - libcurl4-openssl-dev (`libcurl4-openssl-dev` in Debian/Ubuntu)
  - libgdal-dev (`libgdal-dev` in Debian/Ubuntu)
  - libssl-dev (`libssl-dev`in Debian/Ubuntu)
- R libraries for local development:
  - `dplyr`
  - `fontawesome`
  - `leaflet`
  - `lubridate`
  - `R.rsp`
  - `shiny`
  - `shinyjs`
  - `stringr`
  - `tidygeocoder`
- R libraries for [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io) deployment:
  - `anytime`
  - `BH`
  - `shinyWidgets`

### Executing program

#### Map App

- Copy the `initial_tidied_map_data.csv` in the same folder and call it `tidied_map_data.csv`. This is a snapshot of the Parking Reform Network data.
- If you want the most up to date data, run the `generate_map_data.R` script.
- The local path may need to be changed to work on your computer. The intent is to overwrite the `tidied_map_data.csv` file.
- In the R console, run:

```
library(shiny)
runApp('map')
```

- Go to `localhost:[provided port]` in a browser

#### Generating Static Webpages

- To generate static pages for each city, run the `create_city_detail_pages.R` script.
- Again local paths may need to changed. The goal is to output files into the `parking_map/city_detail/` folder.

### Overall

- develop simple standalone map in leaflet/similar
