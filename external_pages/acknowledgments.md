This map and the backing dataset was built and compiled by the <a href="https://parkingreform.org" target="_blank">Parking Reform Network</a> with the help of many generous individuals.

## Concept and Initial Report Data

This project is based on "A Map of Cities That Got Rid of Parking Minimums" intially published by <a href="https://strongtowns.org" target="_blank">StrongTowns</a> in November 2015. Reports have been submitted by many StrongTowns readers over the years and reporters are, generally, credited on the city detailed information pages.
