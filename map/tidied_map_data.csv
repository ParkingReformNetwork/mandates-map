HB2001, passed in 2019,  legalized “missing middle” housing types – such as duplexes, fourplexes, and townhomes – in medium and large cities statewide. The new rules implementing the law “hold mandatory parking ratios at or below one parking space per home.”

HB2001 rules apply to any city with a population greater than 10,000 people and to any city in a metro area with more than 1,000 people. Approximately 58 Oregon cities fall under this definition.

Medium cities had to comply by 6/30/2021 and large cities by 6/30/2022.

Since most of downtown Pomona's existing buildings are only one or two stories high, this provision removes minimum parking requirements for them. New one and two-story buildings are also exempt from parking minimums. Taller new buildings still have minimum parking requirements applied to the upper floors.

The plan also establishes maximum parking requirements, although this limit does not apply to parking spaces that are provided in parking structures.
