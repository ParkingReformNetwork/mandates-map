Since most of downtown Pomona's existing buildings are only one or two stories high, this provision removes minimum parking requirements for them. New one and two-story buildings are also exempt from parking minimums. Taller new buildings still have minimum parking requirements applied to the upper floors.

The plan also establishes maximum parking requirements, although this limit does not apply to parking spaces that are provided in parking structures.
