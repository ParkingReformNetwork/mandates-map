Specifically, the code states that ""Parking requirements do not apply to the first two floors of any proposed development within the MU-CBD or MU-I districts. Moreover, the first two floors of any existing development within said boundaries are also not subject to parking requirements.""

Since most of downtown Pomona's existing buildings are only one or two stories high, this provision removes minimum parking requirements for them. New one and two-story buildings are also exempt from parking minimums. Taller new buildings still have minimum parking requirements applied to the upper floors.

The plan also establishes maximum parking requirements, although this limit does not apply to parking spaces that are provided in parking structures.
